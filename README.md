<h2 align="center">Setup üõ†</h2>

### Prerequisites :

- `npm` is required for installing dependencies. `npm` usually comes blundled with `node`.

  Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/), if it is not installed already.

  To check whether node is present or not, go to your command line / terminal and type in `node --version` .  
  If a version shows up, means node is installed. If not, install the LTS version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/). Check for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) using `npm --version`.

- install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control and for cloning the repository. Verify using `git --version`.
- This app takes weather data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). Which requires an API key. Sign up and generate your own **free** [API](https://openweathermap.org/api) key which will be required during installation process.

### Installation :

> Step 1: Fork [this repo](https://github.com/SandeepKrSuman/weatherpedia)
>
> Step 2: Clone your forked version of this repo locally. To clone, go to your command line / terminal, cd over to an appropriate directory and type in `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/weatherpedia.git`
>
> Step 3: `cd weatherpedia`
>
> Step 4: Open the project in your favourite text editor
>
> Step 5: Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and type in `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?appid=<YOUR API KEY HERE>&units=metric&q=`. Strictly maintian the structure of the url and make sure it ends with `&q=`. Take a look at `.env.example` file for reference. Put your `API Key` in place of `<YOUR API KEY HERE>` and save the `.env` file. (Also note that environment variables in React should start with `REACT_APP_`)
>
> Step 6: On the command line / terminal type in `npm install` to install dependencies
>
> Step 7: Finally run the app using `npm start`
>
> The server will start on port `3000` which can be accessed through <http://localhost:3000/> .
